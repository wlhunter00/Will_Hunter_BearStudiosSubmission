# Will_Hunter_BearStudiosSubmission

Wasn't able to finish it. Had a really busy week. Focus on creating a good looking site that could be expanded on more later.

Only part of the deliverable I couldn't complete would be uploading a photo of a member to replace the previous one due to apache being annoying.
Everything else, including the ticket sales and the emailing I could do.

The best example of a finished page is the members page. You can edit the posts by using the email williamhunter@wustl.edu and the password pikerAdmin.
I loaded in the content for past shows in the same way, I just didn't have time to add the editing features, but I know exactly how I would do it.
Focused more on a showcase of my work vs finished product.
